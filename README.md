# this is a free script to add to a single google ads account to get more visibility over any performance max campaigns running

Note there is now a paid version that does a lot more.
And a paid MCC version that allows you to create the 'insights sheet' for dozens of accounts at once.

And if you find the script helpful - please consider voting for me in the top PPC survey here: https://www.ppcsurvey.com/


If you've never used a script, don't worry it's just cut & paste. 
Here's a quick video to walk you through the process

You'll need to create a copy of the template spreadsheet (that's where all the work is done)
and then enter the URL of YOUR sheet at the top of the script
authorise it & run it.

Once it's all working, set it on a daily schedule. 

Celebrate... you're done!
