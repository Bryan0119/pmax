# this is a script to add to a single google ads account to get more visibility over any performance max campaigns running
# 
# if you've never used a script, don't worry it's just cut & paste. plenty of good youtube resources to help
#
# you'll need to create a copy of the template spreadsheet (that's where all the work is done)
# and then enter the URL of YOUR sheet at the top of the script
# authorise & run. once working, set it on a daily schedule. done!
