# this is a free script to add to a single google ads account to get more visibility over any performance max campaigns running

Note there is now a paid version that does a lot more.
And a paid MCC version that allows you to create the 'insights sheet' for dozens of accounts at once.

If you've never used a script, don't worry it's just cut & paste. 
Here's a quick video to walk you through the process
https://www.loom.com/share/123920288d384e12b691c25ccfb1c951


You'll need to create a copy of the template spreadsheet (that's where all the work is done)
and then enter the URL of YOUR sheet at the top of the script
authorise it & run it.

Once it's all working, set it on a daily schedule. 

Celebrate... you're done!

# Paid Script Info

Thanks for dropping by.
If you’re looking for my paid PMax scripts/sheets, there are two flavors.

If you just need it for a single account - go here: [https://mikerhodes.circle.so/checkout/latest-script](https://mikerhodes.circle.so/checkout/latest-script)

If you want it for multiple accounts, the MCC version makes this much easier. Just add the script once & create the Insights Spreadsheet for every client account you choose. This means much faster updates when I create new versions. It also means client accounts can’t see the code (great for audits!). 
You also get the single account script included when you buy the MCC version.
MCC is here: [https://mikerhodes.circle.so/checkout/latest-mcc-script](https://mikerhodes.circle.so/checkout/latest-mcc-script)

Both scripts come with lifetime updates & free support (on the members' site). As well as training & documentation, much of which is freely available, along with some other scripts here  https://mikerhodes.circle.so/c/free-scripts/

In additional, both scripts come with $100 discount voucher for my ‘scripts & sheets mastery’ training.

## What does the script do?

They both have the same outcome - the creation of the Insights Spreadsheet. 
The MCC script just creates one for each account in your MCC.

The sheet gives you 3 main insights:

where Google is showing your ads (shopping, display, video or search/other)

which search categories your ads are showing for (sorta like search queries)

a ‘product matrix’ that puts all products into 1 of 6 buckets based on performance

For all of these, you get to choose the settings. You pick the date range & the range of metrics for those buckets.

### Spend Allocation

You’ll get account-level insights with metrics for each of the four channels. As well as visuals & a table showing all campaign metrics in one place.

Then, for each individual campaign, you can dive deeper & see the channel split over time (you choose the date range). As well as the search categories for each campaign. And the metrics for each of those.

### Search Categories

Based on a brand term (or terms) that you enter, each search category is put into 1 of 4 buckets. Blank (explained [here](https://mikerhodes.circle.so/c/free-scripts/blank-search-categories-explained)), Brand (exact match to your entered terms), Close-Brand (self explanatory), or Non-Brand if it’s ‘different enough’ from any of your brand terms.

In addition, AOV, CTR & CvR is calculated for each bucket, as well as visualisations to show the performance of each campaign (with respect to these category buckets).

### Product Matrix

This is probably the most popular part of the Insights sheet & is explained in great detail [here](https://mikerhodes.circle.so/c/free-scripts/product-buckets-explained). All products are put into 1 of 6 buckets & various metrics shown for each bucket.

This is done based on the product titles as well as the ID. In addition you get a sheet listing all product IDs with their bucket, so you can easily add a supplemental feed to GMC if you choose.

The Matrix also shows detail for Shopping campaigns, not just PMax by popular demand!

and more…

There are also tabs in the sheet to give you metrics of your Asset Groups & some detail about various video & display assets. This isn’t exhaustive as Google doesn’t make much data available for PMax sadly.

## Training & Support

If you have any questions about [installing](https://mikerhodes.circle.so/c/free-scripts/how-to-install-the-script-for-beginners) the script, or the results you get - or IDEAS for new features. Please let me know. 

I’m continually updating the script & of course as a buyer you get free unlimited upgrades.

You can also use the script on as many accounts as you want, for the entity (agency/business) you’ve bought it for (note if you’re a holding agency, you need to purchase a copy for each legal entity that uses it - you can afford it, please do the right thing, thank you.)

And if you want to learn how to create scripts & spreadsheets like I do, I’ve got a course for that. You get $100 off when you buy a script & it’ll cover everything you need to get started: using Google’s Query Builder, my ‘[101 template](https://mikerhodes.circle.so/c/free-scripts/101)’ script, advanced spreadsheet formulas & much more.

there are even 20 hours of workshop recordings if you really want to go deep down the rabbit hole - but ask me about that once you’ve gone through Mastery.

## What’s next?

Just pick the script that’s right for you :)
